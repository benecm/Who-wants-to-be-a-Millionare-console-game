# Who-wants-to-be-a-Millionare-console-game
This is my first project, also my semester final at university.
Its a simple console game, thats written in C language, made from scratch.
The project only include C language and its basic librarys and an excel that contains all the questions.
After the starting the game the console will appear with 3 options. With the first option the game will start, with the second option the leaderboard will appear.
THe third option closes the game. After entering the game you will get your first question, and you can answer it with a, b, c, or d. You can also use help, like
help from a phone call, or halve that will remove two wrong answers.
